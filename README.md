# EpiStalk

EpiStalk is a test project that I used to learn JavaScript, NodeJS and TypeScript.

I was inspired by Epirank, an old project that retrieved everything from the Epitech's Intranet to make ranks between cities and students.
As a result of an update from Epitech, our grades and ranks are became private. I bypassed this restriction by asking the api key of each user of EpiStalk (reserved to the Epitech students).

## Usage

```
$> ./start.sh
```
